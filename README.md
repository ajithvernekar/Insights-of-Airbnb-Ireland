In this report, we will analyze the Airbnb listing data to identify patterns and trends in the data that could be used to inform business decisions. Specifically, we will focus on the average listing price by neighborhood, the number of listings over time, and the relationship between listing price and review scores. We will also create a map showing the locations of listings, with color indicating the average price in each neighborhood.

## Airbnb Dashboard

The interactive dashboard for the Airbnb project provides a comprehensive overview of the platform's performance in Ireland. The dashboard provides a snapshot of the key metrics such as the total number of hosts, neighbourhoods, reviews, and revenue. These metrics give an idea of the scale and popularity of the platform in the country. The dashboard also includes three navigation buttons that enable users to access more detailed information on Host Analysis and Revenue Analysis. This allows for a deeper dive into specific areas of interest for the user.

The Overview section of the dashboard focuses on the average pricing of Airbnb by neighbourhood, location, distribution of room types, and trends over time. The map visualization provides a clear view of the average pricing in different neighbourhoods, allowing users to identify popular areas and those with high demand. The distribution of room types chart provides insight into the most common types of accommodation offered on the platform. The trend over time chart highlights the changes in pricing over time and allows users to identify seasonal patterns.

The Host Analysis section of the dashboard provides deeper insights into the hosts and regions. The first chart highlights the top 10 hosts by review count, helping users to identify the most popular and active hosts on the platform. The second chart of the dashboard shows the relationship between price and popularity, indicating how the pricing strategy of the hosts affects the popularity of their listings. This section can help users to understand the impact of pricing on the demand for Airbnb listings.
The third chart focuses on the top regions based on reviews, giving users an idea of the most popular regions among users. This information can help users to make informed decisions about the location of their Airbnb listing. Finally, the last section shows the availability of Dublin neighbourhoods by weekday, which can provide useful insights for both hosts and guests to understand the booking patterns in Dublin. This can help users to adjust their pricing and availability strategies accordingly.

The Revenue Analysis section of the dashboard focuses on the impact of different minimum night requirements on the average monthly income and the actual versus target reviews per month for Airbnb listings in Dublin.
The "What If" analysis through varying the minimum night parameter is useful for hosts to optimize their pricing strategy and maximize their earnings. The chart showing the actual versus target reviews per month helps hosts to understand how their listing performance compares to the average performance of other listings in the same neighbourhood.
Overall, this interactive dashboard provides a powerful tool for understanding the performance of Airbnb in Ireland. Its intuitive design and interactive features allow users to explore the data in-depth, enabling them to make informed decisions based on the insights gained
